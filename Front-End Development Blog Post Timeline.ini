It demonstrates how to use container queries to make truly component-level responsive designs (e.g., a card that changes layout based on its container width, not just the viewport). It also shows creative uses of :has() (often called the “parent selector”) to style parent elements based on children (for example, highlight a form field’s label if its input :focus or :invalid). These features were cutting-edge CSS, and by late 2023 support was finally broad enough to use them in production. The post excites readers about how CSS is evolving, referencing that modern browsers are continuously adding powerful CSS capabilities (as seen in State of CSS surveys each year).
	•	Nov 2023: Low-Code and No-Code – Threat or Boon for Developers? – A commentary piece examining the rise of low-code/no-code platforms and what they mean for front-end developers. It discusses popular tools (Webflow, Wix, Bubble, etc.) that allow building web interfaces with minimal coding, and cites statistics about their market growth (for instance, a significant percentage of developers acknowledging using low-code solutions ￼ ￼). The post is balanced: it argues that while no-code tools can handle simple sites and empower non-developers, there will always be a need for developers to build complex, custom applications and to extend or integrate these tools. This reflective post adds variety to the blog content, tackling a trend adjacent to hands-on coding.

2024
	•	Feb 2024: Is React Still King? – State of JS/React 2023 Insights – A post analyzing the latest State of JS and State of React survey results (from late 2023) regarding front-end frameworks. It notes that React is still the most widely used front-end library, but also acknowledges the growing interest in new contenders. For instance, it highlights that smaller companies have been exploring Alpine.js, Solid, and Qwik as alternatives ￼, and that Web Components (through libraries like Lit or Stencil) have niche strongholds in larger organizations ￼. The article discusses whether React’s dominance is eroding or if it’s evolving to meet challenges (mentioning React’s own new features like Server Components and upcoming optimizations). It gives readers context to decide what to focus on in the ever-changing framework landscape.
	•	Apr 2024: The Rise of Signals – Solid, Qwik, and React’s New RFC – Following the signal-based reactivity trend, this post dives into how “signals” (a programming pattern for reactive values) are becoming a hot topic. It explains what signals are in plain terms and why they can be more efficient than useState-style state updates. The post uses examples from SolidJS (which is built on signals) and Qwik’s approach, and also notes that even React’s core team has been discussing signals (e.g., React’s Future useSignal RFC, if applicable by then). It points out that according to recent surveys, frameworks centered on signals have extremely high satisfaction rates among those who try them ￼ ￼. This piece educates readers on the concept that might influence the next generation of frameworks (or the evolution of existing ones).
	•	Jun 2024: AI-Assisted Development – One Year with GitHub Copilot – A reflection on using AI pair-programming tools like GitHub Copilot (which had become widely adopted by 2023) over the past year. The author discusses how it has impacted their workflow – for example, speeding up writing boilerplate code, helping with unfamiliar syntax, or even suggesting test cases. It also touches on limitations and best practices (e.g., don’t blindly accept suggestions, be mindful of potential licensing issues of generated code). As AI integration in development tools became routine by 2024, this post provides a first-hand account of how it practically helps a front-end developer day-to-day, and encourages readers to embrace these tools to augment their productivity.
	•	Sep 2024: Web GPU – Graphics Programming in the Browser – An exploratory tutorial on WebGPU, the new web graphics API (successor to WebGL) which began shipping in browsers (Chrome stable in 2023). The post explains how WebGPU provides more direct access to the GPU for compute tasks and advanced graphics, bringing web graphics closer to native APIs like Vulkan/Metal/DirectX 12. It walks through a simple example of drawing a 3D triangle or running a GPU compute shader in the browser using WebGPU. This article capitalizes on a cutting-edge API, showing the blog’s commitment to covering the forefront of web technologies as of 2024.
	•	Nov 2024: Reflecting on Front-End Trends – What a Decade! – A retrospective opinion piece (framed as if written in late 2024) looking back on the past 10 years of front-end development. The author reminisces about how in 2014–2015 jQuery was everywhere and the term “Single Page App” was just taking off, and contrasts it with 2024’s world of component frameworks, compiled JS, and AI-assisted coding. It highlights a few key turning points covered in this blog series (the ES6 revolution, the framework wars of late 2010s, the performance focus of early 2020s, etc.) and what constants remained (the importance of good UX, performance, accessibility, etc.). This capstone post provides closure to the backdated series, connecting the themes from various years and perhaps teasing optimism about what’s next beyond 2025.

2025
	•	Jan 2025: Next-Gen Build Tools – Turbopacks and Beyond – A forward-looking piece on the state of build tools, spotlighting initiatives like Vercel’s Turbopack (which was introduced as a faster Webpack replacement) and other emerging tools as we enter 2025. It discusses how build tooling is continuing to evolve to make development faster – from esbuild to swc to Turbopack – and speculates on a future with near-instant compilation and smarter caching. This keeps readers informed about what to watch in tooling, building on the trends seen with Vite earlier.
	•	Mar 2025: The Meta-Framework Showdown – Angular, React, Vue in the New Era – A comparative update on the “big three” front-end frameworks as of 2025. It looks at where Angular stands after its numerous updates (perhaps touching on Angular’s adoption of Signals and the standalone components in Angular 16+), how React is adapting (maybe mentioning React 19 or whatever is current, and its ecosystem like Next.js), and Vue’s position (with Vue 3 fully in use and its ecosystem like Nuxt 3). The post cites recent trends (for example, the State of JS 2024 results might show usage and satisfaction numbers for these frameworks) to anchor the discussion in real data. It helps readers decide which framework might suit them by discussing each one’s evolution over the decade and current strengths.
	•	Jun 2025: 20 Years in Front-End – Lessons on Simplicity and Accessibility – A personal retrospective by the author (who has 20 years of experience) discussing timeless lessons learned over two decades of front-end development. The post likely emphasizes that despite all the changing frameworks and tools chronicled in the blog, the core principles remain: keep things simple, focus on solving user problems, prioritize good UX and accessibility from the start. It might share anecdotes of past projects – e.g. how an accessible design improved user engagement, or how choosing a simpler tech stack saved a project from collapse. This reflective piece serves to humanize the journey and inspire newer developers with the idea that while tools come and go, a passion for learning and commitment to users’ needs will always be the foundation of front-end development.
