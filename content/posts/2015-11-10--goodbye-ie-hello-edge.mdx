title: Goodbye IE, Hello Edge – What the End of Internet Explorer Means
date: 2015-11-10
summary: Microsoft moves from Internet Explorer to the new Edge browser, easing life for web developers.
tags: [browsers, microsoft, compatibility]

Windows 10 ships with **Microsoft Edge** as its default browser, replacing Internet Explorer for everyday browsing.  
Edge started the year under the codename *Project Spartan* and was confirmed as IE's successor at Microsoft's Build conference.  

---

## Why this matters

- **Legacy headaches shrink** – many hacks for Internet Explorer 10 and below can be retired.  
- **Standards progress** – Edge implements modern APIs (ES6, Flexbox, SVG filters) without the quirks that haunted IE.  
- **Evergreen updates** – Edge updates through Windows Update, closing the gap with Chrome and Firefox release cycles.  
- **Security** – dropping IE's outdated engine reduces attack surface.

## What to keep in mind

- Some enterprises still rely on old ActiveX or proprietary features.  
- IE 11 remains on Windows 10 for legacy needs and can be launched from Edge's *"Open with Internet Explorer"* option.  
- Always test critical apps in IE 11 until usage stats fall below your project's support threshold.

## Moving forward

1. Audit CSS and JavaScript for IE‑specific work‑arounds.  
2. Replace conditional comments with feature detection (e.g., `@supports` in CSS, `Modernizr` in JS).  
3. Use **ES6** and modern layout (Flexbox, soon Grid) with a transpiler/polyfill fallback only where analytics show need.  
4. Drop obsolete prefixes (e.g., `-ms-`) from new code.  

```css
/* Was: */
@media screen and (-ms-high-contrast: none) { … }

/* Now: */
@supports (display: flex) {
  .nav { display: flex; }
}
```

Edge's standards focus lets developers ship cleaner code sooner.

## Timeline highlights

- **Jan 2015** – *Spartan* shown running on Windows 10 phones.  
- **Apr 2015** – Official name **Microsoft Edge** announced at Build.  
- **Jul 2015** – Windows 10 launches with Edge set as default and IE 11 kept for compatibility.  
- **Nov 2015** – Microsoft begins messaging that future features land in Edge, not IE.  

Edge marks a clean break from the legacy that held the web back for years. Developers can start targeting a modern, evergreen browser on Windows and leave many IE‑only fixes behind.
