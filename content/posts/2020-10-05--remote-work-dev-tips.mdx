Working from home became the new normal for many developers in 2020. For some, it was a smooth transition. For others, it brought new challenges: distractions, isolation, and the need for better time management.

This post shares some practical tips, tools, and habits that help developers stay productive and sane when working remotely.

## Workspace Setup

A good setup makes a huge difference. It doesn’t need to be expensive or fancy.

- Use a dedicated space if possible – avoid working from the couch or bed.
- Invest in a decent chair and desk.
- Use an external monitor and keyboard if you're on a laptop.
- Good lighting helps with video calls and eye strain.
- Use noise-canceling headphones or earplugs for focus.

## Tools for Communication

Keeping in sync with your team is essential. Use tools that help communicate clearly and often.

- **Slack** or **Microsoft Teams** – for real-time messaging and quick updates.
- **Zoom** or **Google Meet** – for stand-ups, pair programming, and one-on-ones.
- **Notion**, **Confluence**, or **Docs** – to write and share long-form updates or decisions.
- **Trello**, **Jira**, or **Linear** – for task tracking and project visibility.

## Time and Task Management

Without the office routine, structure matters even more.

- Block your day with clear work hours and breaks.
- Use a simple task list – pen and paper, Todoist, or your favorite app.
- Turn off non-essential notifications during deep work.
- Use the Pomodoro technique or timeboxing to stay focused.

## Healthy Habits

Remote work can blur the line between personal and work time.

- Set a start and end time to your day.
- Get dressed like you’re going to the office – it signals your brain to switch to work mode.
- Move regularly – stretch, walk, or do a short workout.
- Eat away from your desk.
- Talk to people – isolation is real. Schedule casual calls if needed.

## Mental Health Matters

Remote work can get lonely. Stay connected.

- Join online communities or developer meetups.
- Have non-work chats with teammates.
- Take mental health breaks. It’s fine to pause when needed.

Remote work is here to stay in some form. Learning how to thrive in it is worth the effort.
