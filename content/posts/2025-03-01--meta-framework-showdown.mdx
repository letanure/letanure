The front-end world has changed a lot in the past decade, but the “big three” frameworks—Angular, React, and Vue—are still going strong. In this post, I’ll go over what each looks like today and how they’ve adapted to new trends.

## Angular: Signals and Standalone Components

Angular has seen major changes since v16+. It introduced:

- **Signals**: for fine-grained reactivity, inspired by Solid and others.
- **Standalone components**: now you don’t need NgModules.
- Better DX with faster builds and improved CLI.

Angular is still popular in enterprise projects. It feels more modern now, but the learning curve is still there.

## React: Server Components and the App Router

React kept evolving without changing its core too much. In the latest versions (React 18/19):

- **Server Components** are now usable with frameworks like Next.js.
- **Next.js App Router** supports layouts, loading UI, and nested routing.
- **startTransition** and automatic batching help improve performance.

React is still the default for many devs, especially when combined with Next.js or Remix.

## Vue: Composition API and Nuxt 3

Vue 3 is the default now, and the Composition API is standard:

- Easier logic reuse and better TypeScript support.
- Nuxt 3 gives Vue apps a strong meta-framework.
- Ecosystem is smaller than React’s, but focused.

Vue remains the easiest to get started with, and is used a lot in Asia and by smaller teams.

## Framework Stats

According to the latest State of JS results:

- **React** is still most used.
- **Vue** has high satisfaction.
- **Angular** is stable in large teams, but not trending up.

## Which One?

If you want full control: go with React + Next.js.  
If you want productivity and simplicity: try Vue + Nuxt.  
If you’re in enterprise or need structure: Angular still delivers.

They’ve all improved a lot. Choose the one that fits your project and team.
