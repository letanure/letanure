Atomic Design is a method for creating design systems based on the idea of breaking down UIs into fundamental building blocks. Introduced by Brad Frost, this approach helps teams create scalable, reusable components with a clear hierarchy.

## What is Atomic Design?

Atomic Design structures UI components into five levels:

- **Atoms**: The basic building blocks like buttons, inputs, labels.
- **Molecules**: Simple combinations of atoms. For example, a form label + input + button.
- **Organisms**: Complex UI sections composed of molecules and atoms. Example: a navbar or a card.
- **Templates**: Page-level layouts using organisms and components.
- **Pages**: Final views with real content.

This structure improves consistency and encourages reuse.

## Setting Up a Design System with Atomic Design

1. **Audit your UI**
   - List recurring UI elements (buttons, headings, forms).
   - Identify inconsistencies in spacing, colors, font sizes.

2. **Create your atoms**
   - Use consistent naming.
   - Example: `Button`, `InputField`, `TextLabel`.

```js
// Button.js
export default function Button({ children, onClick }) {
  return <button className="btn" onClick={onClick}>{children}</button>
}
```

3. **Combine into molecules**
   - Pair buttons with inputs or labels.

```js
// SearchBox.js
import Button from './Button'
import Input from './InputField'

export default function SearchBox() {
  return (
    <div className="search">
      <Input placeholder="Search..." />
      <Button>Go</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

4. **Assemble organisms**
   - Sections like headers, footers, or cards.

```js
// Header.js
import Logo from './Logo'
import NavLinks from './NavLinks'

export default function Header() {
  return (
    <header className="site-header">
      <Logo />
      <NavLinks />
    </header>
  )
}
```

5. **Build templates and pages**
   - Wireframe complete layouts using your component library.

## Document Your Components

Use a tool like Storybook to:

- Preview components in isolation
- Display usage guidelines
- Help designers and developers stay aligned

```bash
# Install Storybook
npx sb init
npm run storybook
```

## Why Atomic Design Helps

- Clear structure and naming
- Faster prototyping with reusable components
- Better communication between design and dev
- Easier to onboard new team members

Atomic Design gives you a mental model to create UIs that scale well across teams and projects.
