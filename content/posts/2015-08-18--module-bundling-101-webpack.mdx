Webpack is a **module bundler** that crawls your dependency graph, applies transforms, and emits one or more bundles ready for the browser. [Docs](/)  

## Why bundle?

- Resolve `import` / `require()` at build‑time so browsers get plain scripts.  
- Combine many files into fewer HTTP requests which speeds up first load.  
- Transform code with **loaders** (e.g. Babel turns ES6 → ES5, Sass → CSS, images → base64).  
- Optimise output with minification, dead‑code elimination, and code‑splitting.  
- Enable live editing with **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** — update modules in‑place without a full refresh.  

## Key terms

| Term      | Purpose                                                      |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Entry     | Starting file for building the dependency graph              |
| Output    | Where Webpack writes the final bundle files                  |
| Loader    | Function that transforms matched file types during the build |
| Plugin    | Hook that extends Webpack (minification, env vars, etc.)     |
| Dev Server| Memory‑only server that serves bundles and supports HMR      |
| HMR       | Runtime patching of changed modules without page reload      |

## Project structure

```
my-app/
├─ src/
│  ├─ index.js
│  └─ message.js
├─ dist/
└─ webpack.config.js
```

## Install Webpack 1 and Babel

```bash
# Initialise package.json
npm init -y

# Core bundler and dev server
npm install --save-dev webpack@1 webpack-dev-server@1

# Transpile ES6 to ES5
npm install --save-dev babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-es2015
```

Create a **.babelrc**:

```json
{
  "presets": ["es2015"]
}
```

## webpack.config.js

```js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',

  output: {
    path: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'bundle.js'
  },

  module: {
    loaders: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        loader: 'babel',
        exclude: /node_modules/
      }
    ]
  },

  devServer: {
    static: 'dist',
    inline: true,
    hot: true
  }
};
```

## Demo code

**src/index.js**

```js
import message from './message';

document.body.innerHTML = `<h1>${message}</h1>`;
```

**src/message.js**

```js
export default 'Hello, Webpack!';
```

## Build and run

```bash
# Production bundle
webpack --mode production

# Development server with hot‑reload
webpack-dev-server --hot --open
```

Open the local URL printed in the terminal, edit `src/message.js`, and watch HMR update the page instantly.
