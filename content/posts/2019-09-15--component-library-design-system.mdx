Creating a component library helped us unify the look and feel of an application while speeding up development and improving collaboration with designers.

## Why Build a Component Library?

- Keep styles and behaviors consistent across the app
- Reuse logic and reduce code duplication
- Improve onboarding for new team members
- Share visual language with design team

## Step 1: Identify Reusable Components

Start with the basics:

- Buttons
- Form inputs (text fields, checkboxes, radios)
- Modals and popups
- Notifications and alerts
- Layout containers (grids, wrappers)

List what you use often and generalize patterns that repeat.

## Step 2: Set Up the Component Folder

We created a `/components` folder and grouped things by type.

```bash
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Button/
│   │   ├── Button.tsx
│   │   ├── Button.stories.tsx
│   │   └── index.ts
│   ├── Modal/
│   └── ...
```

Each component has:

- The code
- A test (optional)
- A Storybook story (for visual testing)

## Step 3: Use Storybook

Storybook helped us:

- Document how each component works
- Preview variants (sizes, colors, states)
- Share with designers and QA

```bash
npx sb init
npm run storybook
```

This setup made it easier to demo and test components in isolation.

## Step 4: Add Tokens and Themes

We also added a `theme.ts` file to centralize colors, spacing, font sizes, and other values.

```ts
export const theme = {
  colors: {
    primary: "#0070f3",
    danger: "#e00",
    gray: "#666"
  },
  spacing: [4, 8, 16, 32, 64]
};
```

Then passed the theme into styled components or context providers.

## What We Gained

- Faster development with ready-to-use blocks
- Consistency across screens and developers
- Better handoff from Figma to code
- Easier testing and documentation

A component library is not just for large teams. Even solo projects benefit from consistent UI and code reuse. Once you start building with shared pieces, it’s hard to go back.
