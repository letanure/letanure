GraphQL’s flexibility in allowing clients to request exactly what they need has been a game changer. This post walks through the process of migrating from REST APIs to GraphQL in a real-world frontend project.

## Why We Considered GraphQL

REST was working, but we were facing some problems:
- Over-fetching or under-fetching data
- Multiple roundtrips to load related entities
- Rigid server endpoints and response formats

GraphQL offered:
- A single endpoint
- Control over the shape of the data returned
- Strong tooling and type safety

## Setting Up Apollo Client

We used Apollo Client for data management on the frontend. Basic setup looked like this:

```bash
npm install @apollo/client graphql
```

```js
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, ApolloProvider } from '@apollo/client';

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: '/graphql',
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});
```

Then we wrapped the app with the provider:

```jsx
<ApolloProvider client={client}>
  <App />
</ApolloProvider>
```

## Writing Queries

Instead of calling multiple endpoints, we used queries like this:

```graphql
query GetUser {
  user(id: "123") {
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
      createdAt
    }
  }
}
```

Apollo gave us `useQuery` to fetch this easily:

```js
import { useQuery, gql } from '@apollo/client';

const GET_USER = gql`
  query GetUser {
    user(id: "123") {
      name
      email
      posts {
        title
        createdAt
      }
    }
  }
`;

const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_USER);
```

## Mutations

Updating data was just as clean:

```graphql
mutation AddPost($title: String!) {
  addPost(title: $title) {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

## Benefits Observed

After switching:
- Fewer network requests overall
- Easier frontend development
- Better performance on low-bandwidth devices
- Stronger type safety across the stack

Migrating to GraphQL simplified data handling and improved developer experience. It wasn’t instant, but the gains were clear once we integrated it into real features.
