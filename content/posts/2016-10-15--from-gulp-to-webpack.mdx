title: From Gulp to Webpack – Evolving Build Tools
date: 2016-10-15
summary: Move from code‑driven task runners to config‑driven bundling with Webpack, plus a task‑by‑task cheat sheet.
tags: [webpack, gulp, tooling, javascript]

Many projects that started with **Grunt** or **Gulp** switched to **Webpack** by late 2016 to get built‑in module bundling, dev server live reload, and smarter code splitting.

## Two mental models

### Gulp / Grunt

- You write **JavaScript tasks** (`gulp.task('sass', …)`) that pipe files through a series of plugins.  
- Output goes to `dist/`, then you include built assets with `<script>` tags.  
- Responsibility for dependency graph and live reload belongs to plugins (`gulp‑watch`, `browser‑sync`).  

### Webpack

- You describe **what** the final bundles should look like (`entry`, `output`) and let Webpack walk the dependency graph.  
- Transforms happen through **loaders** (e.g. `babel-loader`).  
- `webpack-dev-server` serves bundles from memory and applies **Hot Module Replacement** automatically.

Both tools use Node streams, but Gulp focuses on file pipelines, while Webpack focuses on module graphs. citeturn0search0turn0search4

## Quick migration cheat sheet

| Need | Gulp/Grunt plugin | Webpack recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ES6 → ES5 | `gulp-babel` | `babel-loader` + `.babelrc` |
| Sass → CSS | `gulp-sass` | `sass-loader` + `MiniCssExtractPlugin` |
| Minify JS | `gulp-uglify` | `TerserPlugin` (built‑in in prod mode) |
| Live reload | `browser-sync` / `gulp-livereload` | `webpack-dev-server --hot` |
| Cache‑bust file names | `gulp-rev` | `[contenthash]` in `output.filename` |

## Minimal Webpack setup

```bash
npm init -y

# Core
npm install --save-dev webpack@1 webpack-cli@1 webpack-dev-server@1

# Transpile ES6
npm install --save-dev babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-es2015
```

Create **webpack.config.js**

```js
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: { filename: 'bundle.[hash].js', path: __dirname + '/dist' },
  module: {
    loaders: [{ test: /\.js$/, loader: 'babel', exclude: /node_modules/ }]
  },
  devServer: { hot: true, inline: true }
};
```

Start in dev mode:

```bash
webpack-dev-server --hot --open
```

---

## Common tasks rewritten

### Transpile & bundle JS

```bash
# Gulp
gulp babel

# Webpack – just run build, loader handles Babel
webpack --mode production
```

### Auto‑reload on file save

```bash
# Gulp + BrowserSync
browser-sync reload

# Webpack dev server
webpack-dev-server --hot
```

### Minify for production

```bash
# Gulp
gulp-uglify

# Webpack prod mode enables TerserPlugin automatically
webpack --mode production
```

---

## Tips for smoother migration

1. Keep the old Gulp build for a sprint; serve the same HTML with Webpack bundle side‑by‑side.  
2. Move **JS first**, then styles/images.  
3. Replace plugin chains with equivalent loaders one at a time.  
4. Use **source maps** (`devtool: 'source-map'`) to debug transpiled code.  
5. Leverage **webpack‑merge** to separate dev and prod configs.

Webpack’s declarative approach cuts down boilerplate and enables advanced optimisations that are hard to replicate with ad‑hoc task runners.
