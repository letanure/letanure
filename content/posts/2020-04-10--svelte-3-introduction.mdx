Svelte 3 introduced a new approach to building web UIs. Instead of using a virtual DOM like React or Vue, Svelte compiles your components at build time into efficient, minimal JavaScript. This means less runtime overhead and better performance.

## Why Svelte Is Different

- No virtual DOM
- Compiles to native JavaScript
- Built-in reactivity without external state management
- Smaller bundle sizes

## Basic Svelte Component

Here's a simple `Counter` component:

```javascript
<script>
  let count = 0;

  function increment() {
    count += 1;
  }
</script>

<button on:click={increment}>
  Clicked {count} times
</button>
```

Any assignment to `count` automatically updates the DOM. You don’t need to use `setState` or call any render functions.

## Setting Up Svelte

You can use the official template to start quickly.

```bash
npx degit sveltejs/template svelte-app
cd svelte-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

This sets up a project with rollup and hot reload.

## Reactive Statements

Svelte also lets you define reactive values based on other variables:

```javascript
<script>
  let a = 1;
  let b = 2;
  $: sum = a + b;
</script>

<p>{a} + {b} = {sum}</p>
```

The `$:` syntax makes `sum` update automatically whenever `a` or `b` changes.

## Styling

Svelte scopes styles to each component:

```javascript
<style>
  button {
    background-color: coral;
    color: white;
  }
</style>
```

No CSS-in-JS or BEM necessary.

## When to Use Svelte

Svelte is a good choice when you want:

- Simple state and logic
- Fast initial load and performance
- Less boilerplate and tooling

It's especially great for personal projects, static sites, or widgets where bundle size matters.

Svelte 3 challenged many assumptions about how frontend frameworks should work. It focused on simplicity and efficiency—values that many developers were looking for in 2020.
