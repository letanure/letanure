Deno is a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript created by Ryan Dahl, the original creator of Node.js. Deno 1.0 was released with some strong opinions and a clear goal: improve on Node by learning from its limitations.

## Key Features

- Built-in TypeScript support
- Uses ES module imports (URLs or local paths)
- No `node_modules` folder or `package.json`
- Secure by default (no file, network, or environment access unless allowed)
- Ships as a single binary
- Comes with built-in utilities like a formatter, bundler, and test runner

## Basic Script Example

```ts
// hello.ts
console.log("Hello from Deno");
```

Run it with:

```bash
deno run hello.ts
```

Deno checks permissions by default. For example, to allow reading files:

```bash
deno run --allow-read hello.ts
```

## Importing Modules

```ts
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.61.0/http/server.ts";

const s = serve({ port: 8000 });
console.log("Listening on http://localhost:8000");

for await (const req of s) {
  req.respond({ body: "Hello Deno\n" });
}
```

- No `npm install`
- No `package.json`
- Modules are cached and compiled once

## Pros

- Simpler setup
- Secure by default
- Strong focus on modern JavaScript
- First-class TypeScript support

## Cons

- Smaller ecosystem compared to Node
- Some missing mature libraries
- Different standard modules from Node.js

## Use Cases

Deno is well-suited for:

- Scripts
- Small web services
- Secure server-side scripting
- Learning modern JavaScript runtime internals

It's still early, but Deno is promising. Whether it replaces Node or carves out a niche remains to be seen. For now, it’s a clean and interesting option, especially for new projects that value security and simplicity.
