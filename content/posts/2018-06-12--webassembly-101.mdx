WebAssembly (Wasm) is a low-level bytecode format designed to run code at near-native speed in modern browsers. It allows developers to compile code from languages like C, C++, or Rust and execute it on the web alongside JavaScript.

WebAssembly reached its 1.0 release and was supported in all major browsers, marking a big step toward making the web a platform for high-performance apps.

## What is WebAssembly?

WebAssembly is:
- A binary format for the web
- Designed for speed and efficiency
- Executed in a safe, sandboxed environment
- Meant to work alongside JavaScript

It’s not meant to replace JavaScript, but to handle tasks where performance is critical—like image manipulation, games, simulations, or video editing.

## Why WebAssembly Matters

- It allows reuse of existing C/C++/Rust codebases on the web.
- It dramatically improves performance for CPU-intensive tasks.
- It expands what’s possible in the browser.

## Basic JavaScript Interop

Once a `.wasm` file is compiled, you can load and run it with JavaScript:

```js
const fs = require("fs");

const wasmBuffer = fs.readFileSync("./example.wasm");

WebAssembly.instantiate(wasmBuffer).then(wasmModule => {
  const result = wasmModule.instance.exports.add(10, 15);
  console.log(result); // 25
});
```

## A Simple Example in C

This C code compiles to WebAssembly:

```c
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

You can use a tool like Emscripten to compile it:

```bash
emcc add.c -s WASM=1 -o add.wasm
```

Then call it from JavaScript as shown above.

## Use Cases

- Game engines and emulators
- Real-time audio/video processing
- Image processing
- Scientific simulations
- Running existing C/C++ libraries in the browser

WebAssembly opened up a new world of performance for the web. It’s not just for C++ developers—it’s a tool that front-end devs can use to unlock new capabilities.
