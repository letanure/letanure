Signals are becoming one of the most discussed ideas in front-end frameworks lately.

They offer a lightweight, fine-grained reactivity model. Unlike traditional state systems like `useState` in React, signals let you track and react to changes at a lower cost.

## What Are Signals?

A signal is a reactive value. You create it once, and when it changes, everything that uses it updates automatically.

In SolidJS:

```js
import { createSignal } from "solid-js"

const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0)

// Reactive usage
<p>Count: {count()}</p>
<button onClick={() => setCount(count() + 1)}>Increment</button>
```

This is different from React’s model, which needs rerendering the whole component to update the UI.

## Why Use Signals?

- Fine-grained updates (only parts that need to change will change)
- Better performance for large or reactive UIs
- More declarative and less boilerplate

## Qwik and Resumability

Qwik also uses signals at its core, but it adds resumability on top. That means it doesn’t hydrate the whole app—only the parts the user interacts with.

```ts
import { component$, useSignal } from "@builder.io/qwik"

export const Counter = component$(() => {
  const count = useSignal(0)

  return (
    <button onClick$={() => count.value++}>
      Count: {count.value}
    </button>
  )
})
```

This makes Qwik fast even on large apps, as only interactive components are hydrated.

## React’s Signals RFC?

React’s core team is also considering a signals-like pattern. While it's still early, the discussion shows interest in moving toward more efficient reactivity in the long run.

## Developer Satisfaction

Frameworks like Solid and Qwik consistently report very high satisfaction in developer surveys. Once developers try signals, they often don’t want to go back.

## Final Thoughts

Signals aren’t just a trend. They represent a shift toward more efficient, scalable UI logic. Whether you’re using Solid, Qwik, or waiting for React’s version, it’s worth learning this pattern now.
