Build tools are evolving again.

Webpack ruled the bundling world for years. Then came faster alternatives like Parcel, Rollup, and later, **esbuild** and **Vite** – built for speed and modern workflows.

Now, it's **Turbopack**’s turn to shake things up.

## What is Turbopack?

Turbopack is a next-gen bundler created by the team at Vercel. It’s written in **Rust**, just like swc (which Vercel also maintains), and aims to be a **Webpack replacement** — but much faster.

Key features:

- Built with performance in mind
- Native support for modern JS and TypeScript
- Incremental compilation and caching
- Great integration with **Next.js**

Turbopack is still early, but already being used in some production apps. It’s expected to become the default bundler for Next.js in the near future.

## How does it compare?

Here’s how some modern build tools stack up:

- **Webpack**: powerful but slower, very flexible
- **esbuild**: ultra-fast but not as extensible
- **swc**: great for transforming code, used in many tools
- **Vite**: fast dev server using esbuild, with Rollup for production
- **Turbopack**: promises best of both worlds with Rust performance and deep framework integration

## A glimpse at the future

We’re heading toward:

- Instant dev servers (cold start < 100ms)
- Smart dependency graphs and caching
- Compile-less environments (e.g. native ESM in browsers)
- Toolchains that work out of the box (zero-config)

As we enter 2025, it’s clear developers care less about bundling theory and more about **instant feedback**, **short feedback loops**, and **fewer moving parts**.

Whether Turbopack becomes the new standard or not, it’s part of a wider move toward faster, leaner, more modern tooling.
