Every year, the State of JS and State of React surveys provide a snapshot of how developers feel about front-end tools.

React continues to be the most used front-end library.

But the surveys also reveal growing curiosity about alternatives like:

- **SolidJS** – praised for speed and fine-grained reactivity
- **Qwik** – focused on resumability and instant loading
- **Alpine.js** – popular in smaller, simpler projects
- **Web Components** – used in larger orgs through tools like Lit or Stencil

React isn't losing popularity, but the ecosystem is more diverse.

Many teams now evaluate whether React is the right choice based on:

- Bundle size
- Build complexity
- Interactivity needs
- Team familiarity

React has evolved with:

- Server Components (RSC)
- Streaming support
- App Router in Next.js
- More async-aware APIs

If you're starting a new project, this is a good time to:

- Reassess your framework needs
- Try out a small experiment with Solid or Qwik
- Explore RSC to simplify server+client logic

The front-end landscape is more open than ever.

React remains strong—but it’s no longer the only path worth exploring.
