# TypeScript Tips and Tricks

TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, making your code more robust and maintainable. Here are some essential tips and tricks.

## Type Inference

```typescript
// TypeScript's type inference
const numbers = [1, 2, 3]; // inferred as number[]
const first = numbers[0]; // inferred as number

interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const user: User = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};
```

## Advanced Types

- Union types
- Intersection types
- Generics
- Type guards
- Utility types

## Best Practices

1. Use strict mode
2. Leverage type inference
3. Create reusable types
4. Document complex types
