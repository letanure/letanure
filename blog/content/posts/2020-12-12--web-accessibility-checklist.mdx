Web accessibility is about making websites usable for everyone, including people with disabilities. This checklist focuses on practical areas where developers can ensure accessibility in their apps.

## Use Semantic HTML

Semantic elements help screen readers and other assistive technologies understand your content:

- Use `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`
- Use `<button>` instead of clickable `<div>` or `<span>`
- Use `<label>` elements properly linked to `<input>` via `for` and `id`

## Add ALT Text to Images

Every `<img>` must have a meaningful `alt` attribute, or `alt=""` if the image is decorative.

## Ensure Keyboard Navigation

Users should be able to:

- Navigate with the `Tab` key
- Activate links and buttons with `Enter` or `Space`
- Avoid getting stuck in keyboard traps

Test this manually or using browser DevTools.

## Use ARIA Roles When Needed

Only when semantic HTML isn’t enough:

```html
<div role="dialog" aria-labelledby="dialogTitle" aria-describedby="dialogDesc">
  ...
</div>
```

Common roles:
- `role="button"`
- `role="dialog"`
- `role="alert"`
- `aria-expanded`, `aria-hidden`, etc.

## Ensure Sufficient Color Contrast

Check foreground and background color contrast ratios. Aim for:

- 4.5:1 for normal text
- 3:1 for large text (18px+ or 14px bold)

Use tools like `color-contrast-checker` or in-browser extensions.

## Provide Focus Styles

Don’t remove focus outlines. If you restyle them, make sure they are clearly visible:

```css
button:focus {
  outline: 2px solid #005fcc;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
```

## Label Form Fields Clearly

- Always associate `<label>`s with form fields
- Use placeholder text only for hints, not as a label substitute
- Group related fields using `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`

## Add Skip Links

Provide a way to skip repetitive content:

```html
<a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">Skip to content</a>
```

Make the link visible when focused.

## Test with Accessibility Tools

- [axe DevTools] browser extension
- Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools
- Screen readers like NVDA (Windows) or VoiceOver (macOS)
- Keyboard-only navigation

## Think About Motion

Reduce unnecessary animations. Respect user preferences:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation: none !important;
    transition: none !important;
  }
}
```

Accessibility is not a feature. It’s part of good web design. Use this checklist to catch problems early and build more inclusive experiences.
