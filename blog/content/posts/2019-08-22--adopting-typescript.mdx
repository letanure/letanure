Switching from JavaScript to TypeScript doesn’t have to be all at once. We migrated a mid-size project over several weeks and learned a lot along the way.

## Why Move to TypeScript?

- Catches common bugs at compile time
- Improves code editor support (autocomplete, refactoring)
- Makes collaboration easier with better-defined types

## Step 1: Enable Gradual Typing

Use `allowJs` to let JavaScript and TypeScript files coexist:

```json
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowJs": true,
    "checkJs": false,
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "target": "es6",
    "module": "commonjs"
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"]
}
```

This way, we converted files incrementally.

## Step 2: Add JSDoc for Existing JS

For files not yet converted, add basic JSDoc types:

```js
/**
 * @param {string} name
 * @returns {string}
 */
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
}
```

This gave us editor type checking without converting everything to `.ts`.

## Step 3: Convert Files Slowly

We started by converting utility functions and new files to `.ts`.

- Kept `.js` files untouched where stable
- Converted shared types to `.d.ts` or `.ts` files
- Used type aliases and `any` when stuck, then refined

## Step 4: Deal with Third-Party Types

Many packages don’t ship types. Use DefinitelyTyped:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/lodash
```

Or add your own quick fix in `types.d.ts`:

```ts
declare module 'my-untagged-lib';
```

## Wins We Saw Early

- Found bugs like undefined props
- Simplified debugging with better autocomplete
- Cleaner function contracts and return types

## Common Tips

- Don’t rewrite the app all at once
- Use `any` and `@ts-ignore` only temporarily
- Start with the files that get touched the most
- Define shared interfaces and types early

The migration wasn’t free, but TypeScript brought real, daily benefits. If your team is on the fence, try a partial rollout and see how it improves the workflow.
