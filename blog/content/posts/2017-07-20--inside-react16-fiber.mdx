React 16 ships with **Fiber**, a total rewrite of the reconciliation engine aimed at smoother UIs and better error handling.

## What is Fiber?

- Breaks rendering into small units of work called *fibers*.  
- Allows React to **pause, resume, and prioritise** rendering, preventing long blocks.  
- Enables future features like time‑slicing and concurrent rendering.

## Practical wins in React 16

1. **Error boundaries** – components can catch render errors and show fallback UI.  
2. **Return arrays from render** – no extra wrapper elements needed.  
3. **Portals** – render children into a different DOM subtree.  
4. **Smaller bundle** – core size dropped compared with React 15.  
5. **Better SSR** – streaming server‑side rendering support.

## Minimal error boundary

```jsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  state = { hasError: false };

  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    this.setState({ hasError: true });
    // log error or send to monitoring
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

Wrap parts of your app:

```jsx
<ErrorBoundary>
  <ProfilePage />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

## Returning multiple elements

```jsx
function List() {
  return [
    <li key="a">A</li>,
    <li key="b">B</li>
  ];
}
```

Later versions added the shorter `<>…</>` fragment syntax.

## When Fiber matters

- Complex updates like animations or rich editors benefit from interruptible rendering.  
- Apps with heavy trees gain smoother scrolling and gestures.  
- Error boundaries keep the rest of the UI running after a crash.

## Upgrade notes

- Public API is mostly unchanged; update warnings from React 15 should be resolved first.  
- Old lifecycle hooks (`componentWillMount`, etc.) may show deprecation warnings.  
- Third‑party libraries generally work; check those touching internals.

React 16’s Fiber engine lays the groundwork for future concurrent features while already improving stability and developer experience.
