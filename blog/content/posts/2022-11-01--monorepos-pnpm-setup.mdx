Managing multiple front-end projects or packages in a single codebase can be a pain. That’s where **monorepos** come in.

Monorepos allow you to keep multiple apps and shared packages (like a design system) in the same repository, with a unified workflow. In 2022, PNPM and its **workspace** feature became one of the most popular ways to manage monorepos in JavaScript/TypeScript projects.

## Why use a monorepo?

- Easier dependency management (one lockfile)
- Easier to share and reuse components or utilities
- Better consistency across packages
- Simplified CI/CD pipelines

## Why PNPM?

PNPM uses a content-addressable store and symlinks instead of copying node_modules. That means:

- Much faster install times
- Less disk space usage
- Better hoisting behavior

Compared to Yarn and npm, PNPM’s performance and workspace isolation made it a strong candidate for monorepo setups.

## Setting up a monorepo with PNPM

Let’s create a basic structure:

```bash
mkdir my-monorepo
cd my-monorepo
pnpm init
```

Now set up `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:

```yaml
packages:
  - "apps/*"
  - "packages/*"
```

Then create folders:

```bash
mkdir -p apps/web
mkdir -p packages/ui
```

Inside each, add a `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "web",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "ui",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js"
}
```

Now you can install and link packages:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm add ui --filter web
```

This links the `ui` package into `web`, all locally.

## Tips

- Use `pnpm dev` or scripts in the root to run across packages
- Combine with tools like TurboRepo or Nx for more control
- Keep each package isolated and documented

Monorepos with PNPM are a great way to keep large projects organized and fast. Whether you're building multiple apps or just sharing a design system, it's worth trying.
