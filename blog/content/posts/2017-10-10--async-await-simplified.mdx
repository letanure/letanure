summary: Refactor promise chains into clean async functions with try/catch error handling.

`async` and `await` landed in ES2017, letting developers write asynchronous code that reads like synchronous steps.

## Before: Promise chain

```js
function fetchUser(id) {
  return fetch(`/api/users/${id}`)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => {
      console.log('User:', data);
    })
    .catch(err => console.error(err));
}
```

Nested `.then()` calls grow quickly and push error handling to the end.

## After: async / await

```js
async function fetchUser(id) {
  try {
    const res = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);
    const data = await res.json();
    console.log('User:', data);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
}
```

### How it works

- `async` marks the function, returning a promise automatically.
- `await` pauses execution until the promise resolves, yielding the result.
- `try/catch` handles both network errors and thrown exceptions.

## Sequential vs parallel

```js
// sequential
await stepOne();
await stepTwo();

// parallel
const [a, b] = await Promise.all([stepOne(), stepTwo()]);
```

Use `Promise.all` to start tasks together, then await their combined result.

## Tips

- Always wrap awaited code in `try/catch` for proper error handling.
- Combine with `Promise.allSettled` for bulk operations where some may fail.
- Keep `async` functions small; extract chunks to maintain readability.

Async/await became mainstream in 2017, replacing many callback and promise chains with clear top‑to‑bottom control flow.
