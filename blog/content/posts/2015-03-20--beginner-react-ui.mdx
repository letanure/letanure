title: Building UIs with React.js – A Beginner’s Tutorial
date: 2015-03-20
summary: Learn the core ideas of React 0.13 and build a small interactive UI.
tags: [react, javascript, ui]
---

React is a library for creating user interfaces with a **component‑based** approach and a **virtual DOM** diffing engine.

React 0.13 (released March 2015) added optional ES6 class support but `React.createClass` remains the common style.

---

## Why React changes front‑end work

- **Component isolation** – each piece of UI is a self‑contained function of props and state.  
- **Virtual DOM** – React builds an in‑memory tree and updates only the changed parts on the real DOM, avoiding full page reflows.  
- **One‑way data flow** – parent → child props keep data reasoning straight.  
- **Declarative rendering** – describe *what* the UI looks like; React figures out *how* to update it.

*(Check the React v0.13 release notes for details on class support and goals.)*

## Quick setup

Add React, ReactDOM, and JSX transformer via CDN:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/0.13.3/react.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/0.13.3/react-dom.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-core/5.8.23/browser.min.js"></script>
<div id="app"></div>
```

Write components in a `<script type="text/babel">` block.  
The browser runs Babel in‑place to transform JSX into plain JavaScript.

### Counter component

Uses `React.createClass` and local state.

```jsx
const Counter = React.createClass({
  getInitialState() {
    return { count: 0 };
  },
  add() {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  },
  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.add}>
        Clicked {this.state.count} times
      </button>
    );
  }
});
```

---

### App wrapper

Holds the Counter and shows a heading.

```jsx
const App = React.createClass({
  render() {
    return (
      <section>
        <h1>Demo: React Counter</h1>
        <Counter />
      </section>
    );
  }
});
```

---

### Rendering

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('app'));
```

React builds a virtual DOM tree from `App`, compares it with the previous tree on every `setState`, and patches only the node that displays the count.

---



### JSX syntax

JSX lets you write HTML‑like tags in JavaScript. Babel turns this syntax into `React.createElement` calls.

```jsx
const element = <h1 className="title">Hello React</h1>;
```

The code above compiles to:

```js
const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  { className: 'title' },
  'Hello React'
);
```

---

### Props versus state

- **Props**: read‑only data passed from parent to child.  
- **State**: mutable data local to a component.  

State changes with `setState()` cause React to re‑render the component and its children. Props flow down; state stays inside.


## Key takeaways

- Components bundle markup, logic, and state.  
- State changes trigger efficient re‑renders through the virtual DOM diff.  
- Composition lets small pieces form complex UIs.  

This counter shows the minimum needed to start. Expand with more components, props, and events to grow a full application.
