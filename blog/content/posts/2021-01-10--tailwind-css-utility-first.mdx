Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that encourages building UIs directly in your HTML using small, reusable utility classes.

Unlike traditional frameworks like Bootstrap that give you components, Tailwind gives you the building blocks. You style elements by composing utility classes right in your markup.

## Why Tailwind?

- Encourages consistency without writing custom CSS
- Lets you prototype fast
- Avoids naming confusion with class names
- Supports dark mode, responsive design, and variants out of the box

## Getting Started

Install Tailwind using npm:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
```

Configure the generated `tailwind.config.js` file if needed.

Set up Tailwind to process your CSS:

```css
/* ./src/styles.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

And in your build tool (like PostCSS):

```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/styles.css -o ./dist/styles.css --watch
```

## Example: Card Component

```html
<div class="max-w-sm rounded overflow-hidden shadow-lg">
  <img class="w-full" src="/img/card-top.jpg" alt="Card image">
  <div class="px-6 py-4">
    <div class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">Tailwind Card</div>
    <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">
      This is a simple card built with Tailwind utility classes.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Design Without Leaving HTML

One of Tailwind’s main ideas is: design and implementation should happen in the same place. You don't write new class names in CSS files. You compose them using existing utilities:

- `text-center`, `text-lg`, `font-semibold`
- `bg-blue-500`, `hover:bg-blue-700`, `text-white`

## Responsive Design

Tailwind uses a mobile-first approach with simple prefixes:

```html
<div class="text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">Responsive text</div>
```

## Final Thoughts

Tailwind CSS promotes a shift from traditional CSS thinking. Instead of writing custom styles and managing class names, you rely on predefined building blocks.

It feels strange at first but once you get used to it, the speed and consistency are hard to beat.
