This post continues the exploration of serverless by showing how to create a REST API using serverless functions.

## What Is Serverless?

Serverless doesn't mean there's no server. It means:

- You don't manage the server.
- You write functions that respond to HTTP events.
- They scale automatically and only run when called.

## Example Project: Guestbook API

Create an API to:

- `GET /entries` – fetch all guestbook entries
- `POST /entries` – add a new entry

## Option 1: Netlify Functions

### 1. Setup

```bash
npm install netlify-cli -g
netlify init
netlify functions:create
```

Create a file at `netlify/functions/entries.js`:

```js
exports.handler = async (event) => {
  if (event.httpMethod === "GET") {
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify([{ name: "Luiz", message: "Great blog!" }]),
    };
  }

  if (event.httpMethod === "POST") {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.body);
    return {
      statusCode: 201,
      body: JSON.stringify({ saved: true, data }),
    };
  }

  return { statusCode: 405 };
};
```

Run locally:

```bash
netlify dev
```

Call from front-end with fetch:

```js
fetch("/.netlify/functions/entries")
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

## Option 2: AWS Lambda + API Gateway

This requires more setup, but is useful for production:

- Use AWS SAM or Serverless Framework
- Define function handler and route via API Gateway
- Deploy with AWS CLI

## Benefits

- No server provisioning or maintenance
- Scales automatically
- Pay per request
- Works well with static frontends (like JAMstack sites)

Serverless is more than just a trend. It’s a solid way to build real APIs without the weight of traditional backend stacks.
