Micro-frontends are a way to split a large front-end application into smaller, more manageable pieces. Each piece (or "micro-frontend") is owned by a different team and can be developed, deployed, and updated independently.

This idea comes from microservices, but applied to the front-end.

## What Are Micro-Frontends?

- **Independent front-end apps** that can be developed and deployed separately.
- Often loaded at runtime into a main "shell" or container application.
- Useful in large teams or enterprise apps where different parts of the UI evolve separately.

## Benefits

- **Independent deployments**: Teams can release their features without coordinating with others.
- **Technology flexibility**: Teams can use different stacks (React, Vue, etc.) if needed.
- **Team autonomy**: Smaller teams can take full ownership of their parts of the UI.
- **Code isolation**: Reduced risk of regressions across unrelated parts of the app.

## Challenges

- **Initial setup complexity**
- **Cross-team coordination**
- **Shared dependencies** (e.g., design systems, global state)
- **Performance and loading times** (more assets to download)

## Example Use Case

Imagine an e-commerce site:

- **Homepage**: Core team
- **Product Search**: Search team
- **Product Details**: Catalog team
- **Shopping Cart**: Checkout team
- **User Profile**: Account team

Each of these could be a micro-frontend, deployed on its own and integrated into a shared layout.

## Approaches

### Server-Side Composition

- Each micro-frontend is rendered on the server and merged before being sent to the browser.
- Works well with traditional server-rendered apps.

### Client-Side Composition

- The shell app loads each micro-frontend at runtime via JavaScript.
- Allows more flexibility but needs careful handling of dependencies.

### Webpack Module Federation (introduced in Webpack 5)

```js
// Example config snippet
new ModuleFederationPlugin({
  name: 'checkout',
  filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
  exposes: {
    './Cart': './src/components/Cart',
  },
  shared: ['react', 'react-dom'],
});
```

## When to Use Micro-Frontends

- You have **many teams** working on the same front-end codebase.
- You want **independent deployments**.
- You maintain **separate domains** of business logic.
- Your app is **too large** for a single team to own or understand.

If you're in a small team or project, micro-frontends may add more complexity than value.

## Final Thoughts

Micro-frontends aren’t for every project. But for large apps with many teams, they can help scale your architecture in a clean and maintainable way.
