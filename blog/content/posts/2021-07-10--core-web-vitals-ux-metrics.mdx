Core Web Vitals are a set of metrics defined by Google to evaluate the user experience of a web page. They focus on loading speed, interactivity, and visual stability.

These three metrics became especially important for front-end developers when they started to influence search ranking.

## What are Core Web Vitals?

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Measures loading performance. A good score is under 2.5 seconds.
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: Measures interactivity. A good score is under 100ms.
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Measures visual stability. A good score is below 0.1.

## Tips to Improve Core Web Vitals

### Improving LCP

- Use lazy loading for images and videos
- Optimize critical rendering path
- Serve images in modern formats like WebP
- Reduce server response times

### Improving FID

- Minimize main-thread blocking time
- Reduce JavaScript bundle size
- Use web workers for heavy computation
- Split code using dynamic `import()`

### Improving CLS

- Always include width and height on images and videos
- Reserve space for ads and embeds
- Avoid injecting content above existing content
- Use CSS `aspect-ratio` to maintain size stability

## How to Measure Core Web Vitals

You can test your site using:

- Lighthouse (in Chrome DevTools)
- PageSpeed Insights
- Web Vitals Chrome Extension
- Real-user monitoring tools

```bash
# Run Lighthouse in CLI
npm install -g lighthouse
lighthouse https://your-site.com
```

Improving these metrics not only helps SEO but also provides a better experience for users across devices and connection speeds.
