title: Writing Future‑Proof Code with Babel
date: 2015-06-12
summary: Use Babel to compile ES6+ JavaScript into browser‑friendly ES5.
tags: [babel, javascript, tooling]

Babel is a JavaScript compiler.  
It converts modern syntax into code that older browsers understand.  
In 2015 this made it possible to use ES6 features in production while IE‑only engines were still common.

---

## Why Babel matters

- **Early access** – arrow functions, classes, modules, and more without waiting for native support  
- **Config file** – `.babelrc` keeps presets and plugins in one place  
- **Plugin system** – choose only the transforms you need  
- **Multiple outputs** – turn ES modules into CommonJS, AMD, or System formats  

---

## Project setup

```bash
# Install CLI and the ES2015 preset locally
npm install --save-dev babel-cli babel-core babel-preset-es2015

# Optional: watcher for automatic rebuilds
npm install --save-dev babel-watch
```

Create **.babelrc**:

```json
{
  "presets": ["es2015"]
}
```

---

## Example: Transpile a small module

**src/math.js**

```js
export const PI = 3.14;
export const double = n => n * 2;
```

Build the file:

```bash
# One‑off build
npx babel src --out-dir lib

# Continuous build during development
npx babel-watch src --out-dir lib
```

**lib/math.js** (output)

```js
'use strict';

Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", {
  value: true
});
var PI = exports.PI = 3.14;
var double = exports.double = function double(n) {
  return n * 2;
};
```

The ES6 `export` statements become CommonJS assignments, ready for Node or older browsers after bundling.

---

## Common build integrations

- **Browserify** – add `babelify` as a transform  
- **Grunt / Gulp** – run `grunt-babel` or `gulp-babel` in the task pipeline  

---

## Key ES6 features you can ship today

- `let` and `const` block‑scoped variables  
- Arrow functions with lexical `this`  
- Classes with concise method syntax  
- Template literals with `${}` interpolation  
- Destructuring for arrays and objects  

Each transform is handled by the preset, so the workflow stays simple after the initial install.

Babel removes the waiting game.  
Write modern JavaScript, compile once, and run everywhere.
