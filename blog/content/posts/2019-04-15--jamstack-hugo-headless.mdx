JAMstack stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. It’s an approach to building websites that are static, fast, and secure—but powered by dynamic content from APIs.

We’ll walk through creating a site using Hugo, a static site generator written in Go, and pulling data from a headless CMS.

## Why JAMstack?

JAMstack separates:
- The frontend (markup, HTML, JS)
- The content (delivered by APIs or CMS)
- The build process (pre-rendered at deploy time)

Benefits:
- Fast loading from static hosting (CDN)
- Improved security (no backend server to hack)
- Easier scaling
- Better DX with modern tools

## Step 1: Install Hugo

```bash
brew install hugo
hugo new site jamstack-demo
cd jamstack-demo
```

Pick a theme:

```bash
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke themes/ananke
echo 'theme = "ananke"' >> config.toml
```

## Step 2: Create Pages

```bash
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
```

Edit the post in `content/posts/my-first-post.md`:

```markdown
---
title: "My First Post"
date: 2019-04-15
---

This is my first JAMstack post powered by Hugo.
```

## Step 3: Pull Content from a Headless CMS

Use a script (Node or Go) to fetch content via API from a CMS like:
- Contentful
- Sanity
- Strapi

Save it as Markdown files into `content/posts/`.

Example fetch and write:

```js
// fetch-posts.js
const fs = require('fs');
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

async function getPosts() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.mycms.com/posts');
  const posts = await res.json();

  posts.forEach(post => {
    const content = `---
title: "${post.title}"
date: "${post.date}"
---

${post.body}
`;
    fs.writeFileSync(`content/posts/${post.slug}.md`, content);
  });
}

getPosts();
```

Run this script before building the site:

```bash
node fetch-posts.js
hugo
```

## Step 4: Deploy to Netlify

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify init
netlify deploy
```

Using Hugo and a headless CMS shows how JAMstack can be flexible, fast, and suitable for both small sites and large content-driven platforms.
