Redux became the most popular Flux‑inspired state library during 2016, thanks to Dan Abramov’s time‑travel demo at React Europe and rapid community adoption.

---

## Core concepts

- **Store** – holds one immutable state tree.  
- **Action** – plain object that describes “what happened”.  
- **Reducer** – pure function `(state, action) ⇒ newState`.  
- **Dispatch** – send an action to update state.  
- **Provider** – React binding that makes the store available.

---

## Install and set up

```bash
# Add Redux and React bindings
npm install redux react-redux --save
```

Create **src/store.js**

```js
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import rootReducer from './reducer';

const store = createStore(rootReducer);
export default store;
```

---

## Write a reducer

```js
// src/reducer.js
const initial = { count: 0 };

export default function reducer(state = initial, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'counter/inc':
      return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

Reducers return new objects; they never mutate the old state.

---

## Define an action creator

```js
export const inc = () => ({ type: 'counter/inc' });
```

Actions are serialisable, making time‑travel debugging possible.

---

## Wire Redux into React

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Provider, useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import store, { inc } from './store';

function Counter() {
  const count = useSelector(s => s.count);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  return (
    <button onClick={() => dispatch(inc())}>
      Clicked {count}
    </button>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <Counter />
    </Provider>
  );
}
```

`useSelector` reads from the store, and `dispatch` sends actions. React components stay stateless; Redux owns the data flow.

## Why Redux gained traction

- **Predictability** – single source of truth and pure reducers make bugs easier to trace.  
- **DevTools time travel** – rewind and replay actions while editing code.  
- **Tiny API** – just a handful of functions compared with heavier Flux variants.  
- **Strong React pairing** – `react-redux` 5.0 landed late 2016, optimised for React 15+.  
- **Community learning** – free Egghead course and countless tutorials helped newcomers.  
- **Survey love** – State of JS 2016 showed Redux leading satisfaction charts.

## Keep it simple

Start with one reducer; split later with `combineReducers`.  
Avoid over‑architecting small apps—Redux shines when state is shared across many components.
