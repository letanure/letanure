title: GraphQL Basics – Querying APIs the Modern Way
date: 2017-11-15
summary: Learn how GraphQL lets clients ask for just the data they need and avoid over‑fetching common with REST.
tags: [graphql, api, tutorial]

GraphQL offers a single endpoint where clients send **queries** describing the exact fields they require.  
The server returns a JSON object with that shape—no more, no less.

## REST vs GraphQL

### Typical REST flow

```text
GET /users/42          → user object
GET /users/42/repos    → list of repos
GET /users/42/followers → list of followers
```

Multiple round‑trips fetch related data, often including fields the UI never shows.

### GraphQL equivalent

```graphql
{
  user(id: 42) {
    name
    repos(limit: 3) { name stars }
    followers(limit: 5) { name }
  }
}
```

One request gets everything, trimmed to what the UI needs.

## Query structure

- **Fields**: properties you want returned.  
- **Arguments**: refine results (`limit`, `order`).  
- **Fragments**: reusable field sets.  
- **Variables**: externalise arguments to avoid string interpolation.

Example with variables:

```graphql
query($id: ID!) {
  user(id: $id) {
    name
    avatar
  }
}
```

Send `{ "id": 42 }` in the request body under `variables`.

## Try it yourself (GitHub API)

1. Create a personal token with `read:user` scope.  
2. POST to `https://api.github.com/graphql` with header `Authorization: bearer <token>`.  
3. Send the query above to fetch your profile fields.

---

## Schema language

A server publishes types:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  repos(limit: Int = 5): [Repo!]!
}

type Repo {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  stars: Int!
}

type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
}
```

The client introspects this schema to know which fields exist and their types.

## Benefits for front‑end devs

- **Exact data** – smaller payloads, faster rendering.  
- **Single round‑trip** – fewer spinners.  
- **Strong typing** – tools like autocomplete and compile‑time checks.  
- **Versionless** – add fields without breaking clients.

---

## Building a simple schema (Node)

```bash
npm init -y
npm install graphql express express-graphql
```

```js
const { graphqlHTTP } = require('express-graphql');
const { buildSchema } = require('graphql');
const express = require('express');

const schema = buildSchema(`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`);

const root = { hello: () => 'Hello GraphQL' };

express()
  .use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP({ schema, rootValue: root, graphiql: true }))
  .listen(4000);
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4000/graphql` and run `{ hello }`.

GraphQL gained traction in 2017 as teams realised its power to streamline data fetching and reduce boilerplate compared with traditional REST endpoints.
