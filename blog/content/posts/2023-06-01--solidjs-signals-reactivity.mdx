SolidJS is a front-end framework that takes a different path than React or Vue. It doesn't use a virtual DOM. Instead, it relies on fine-grained reactivity powered by signals.

### Why Signals?

In Solid, signals are reactive values that automatically update your UI when they change.

Here's a simple example:

```js
import { createSignal } from "solid-js";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

  return (
    <>
      <p>Count: {count()}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count() + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

Unlike React, you don't write `useState` and `useEffect`. The component is reactive by default. `count()` triggers re-renders only where it's used, not the entire component.

### How Solid Differs

- No virtual DOM
- Compile-time optimizations
- Fine-grained reactive updates
- Small bundle sizes

### Solid vs React

React updates components as a whole. Solid updates DOM nodes directly. This results in better performance for many use cases, especially smaller projects or embedded widgets.

### Signals Everywhere

Solid’s model is gaining attention. Other frameworks are also exploring signal-based reactivity:

- **Preact** introduced `signals` as an experiment
- **Vue** has its `ref()` API
- **Qwik** uses resumable reactivity

Developers are now exploring frameworks that prioritize performance with minimal abstraction.

### When to Use Solid

Use Solid if you:

- Care a lot about runtime performance
- Are building small or medium apps
- Want simpler mental models for reactivity
- Like JSX but want more control

Solid is not trying to replace React but offers a clean and fast alternative where simplicity and speed matter most.
