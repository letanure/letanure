React Hooks were introduced in version 16.8. They let you use state and lifecycle features in functional components. This changed how many people write React apps.

## Why Hooks?

Before Hooks, you had to use class components to:
- Manage state
- Use lifecycle methods
- Share logic between components

Hooks made this easier by adding functions like `useState` and `useEffect`.

## useState Example

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

No constructor, no `this`, just clean and readable.

## useEffect Example

```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Timer() {
  const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setSeconds(prev => prev + 1);
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  return <p>{seconds} seconds have passed.</p>;
}
```

`useEffect` replaces `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.

## Replacing a Class Component

Old class component:

```js
class Counter extends React.Component {
  state = { count: 0 };

  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
        {this.state.count}
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

Now with Hooks:

```js
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>;
}
```

## Why This Matters

Hooks:
- Simplify code
- Avoid class boilerplate
- Make it easier to reuse logic with custom hooks

Hooks changed the way we write React apps. They’re simple, flexible, and work well with today’s component-based design.
