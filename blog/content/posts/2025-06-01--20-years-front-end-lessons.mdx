Twenty years. That’s a long time in front-end.

In that time, we’ve gone from jQuery plugins and table layouts to React Server Components and Edge Functions. But some lessons don’t change. Here are the ones that stuck with me.

## 1. Keep it simple

Complexity breaks things. Users don’t care if you used the latest framework. They care that the site loads fast and works. Simple stacks are easier to debug, easier to maintain, and easier to hand off.

I’ve seen projects collapse under the weight of over-architecture. A hand-rolled toolchain, six layers of abstraction, and no one left to maintain it. Meanwhile, a plain HTML/CSS/JS version would have done the job.

## 2. Design for users, not devs

Sometimes we get caught up solving our own problems. But front-end is about *users*. Every decision – from layout to color contrast – affects real people.

Example: a project I worked on had amazing animations and transitions. But users on low-end phones couldn't use it. We stripped things down. The result was faster, more inclusive, and users actually stayed.

## 3. Accessibility isn't optional

Making your app accessible helps everyone. Keyboard users. Screen readers. People on mobile in the sun. Accessibility isn’t a feature – it’s baseline.

Use semantic HTML. Add ALT text. Ensure keyboard navigation. Follow WCAG basics. These are not hard, and they go a long way.

One small win: we added proper labels and focus states to a booking form. Suddenly, conversion went up. Why? Because more people could actually complete it.

## 4. Learn new tools, but trust your principles

New frameworks will keep coming. Some good. Some overhyped. Learn them, but stay grounded. Your job isn’t to use the newest thing. Your job is to build things people can use.

Performance, clarity, and usefulness win every time.

## 5. You won’t remember every syntax, but you’ll remember what works

After two decades, I don’t remember every version of every tool I used. But I remember the bugs that cost me hours. The fixes that made a real difference. The tools that respected my time.

The tech changes. The value stays the same.

Thanks for reading. Whether you’re starting out or deep in your career, remember: people > tools, clarity > cleverness, and function > flair.
