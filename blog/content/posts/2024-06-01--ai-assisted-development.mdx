AI pair-programming tools are no longer hype. After using GitHub Copilot daily for over a year, I can say it’s changed how I code – and not just in small ways.

## What Copilot Helps With

Here’s where Copilot saves me time every day:

- **Boilerplate** – It writes out `useEffect`, `useState`, API call scaffolding, even basic CSS and Tailwind classes.
- **Unknown syntax** – If I vaguely remember how to write a Prisma query or a new regex pattern, it fills the gap.
- **Test cases** – I write a function, and it often autocompletes good test scenarios using Vitest or Jest.
- **String manipulation or parsing** – These are boring. Copilot makes them fast.
- **Markdown, README, docs** – I don’t love writing these, but Copilot makes suggestions to speed it up.

## What Copilot Gets Wrong

Copilot isn’t magic. It guesses.

- It sometimes makes things up.
- You still need to verify logic and types.
- It might pull in patterns that are outdated or not idiomatic.
- It doesn’t understand the big picture of your code – only what’s around your cursor.

## How to Use It Well

- **Be active** – Treat Copilot like a junior pair. Let it start, but you edit.
- **Edit heavily** – Use suggestions as a base. Don’t trust without reading.
- **Avoid for sensitive or license-restricted code** – Generated output might not be safe to copy blindly.

## Overall Impact

After a year, I’m more productive. I write more. I finish side projects faster. I explore unfamiliar libraries without getting blocked.

The key? I use it as a boost, not a crutch.

Copilot won’t replace you. But it can help you code more, try more, and learn faster – if you drive the process.
