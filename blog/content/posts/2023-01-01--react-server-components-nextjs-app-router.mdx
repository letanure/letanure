React Server Components (RSC) and the new App Router in Next.js 13 introduced a new way of thinking about React apps.

This post explains what changed, why it matters, and how to start using it today.

## What Are React Server Components?

React Server Components run on the server and send a serialized component tree to the browser.

This has a few benefits:

- Smaller JavaScript bundles (because server-only code doesn't go to the browser)
- Faster initial load (streaming HTML from server)
- More flexibility in separating concerns between client and server

RSC lets you write components like this:

```tsx
// app/posts/page.tsx
import { fetchPosts } from './data'

export default async function PostsPage() {
  const posts = await fetchPosts()

  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

This component is server-rendered by default. You can fetch data directly and render output without sending any of that logic to the client.

## The App Router

Next.js 13 introduces a new `app/` directory.

Main differences:

- Routing is now based on folders inside `app/`
- Server and client components are mixed by default
- Data fetching is built-in to components using async/await
- Layouts and templates offer new control over structure and caching

Basic file structure:

```
app/
  layout.tsx
  page.tsx
  dashboard/
    layout.tsx
    page.tsx
```

Each `page.tsx` exports a route. Each `layout.tsx` wraps the routes below it.

## Mixing Server and Client Components

By default, components are rendered on the server. To opt into client-side rendering, add a directive:

```tsx
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>
}
```

Use this when:

- You need interactivity (hooks, event listeners)
- You use browser-only APIs

## When to Use RSC

Use RSC for:

- Static or dynamic data fetching
- Markup generation
- Parts of the UI that donâ€™t need interactivity

Use client components for:

- Forms
- Buttons
- Real-time updates

## Why It Matters

React Server Components and the App Router reduce boilerplate, make routing clearer, and shift more logic to the server. This leads to faster, leaner apps.

Give it a try if:

- You're starting a new Next.js project
- You want better performance with less client JavaScript
- You're ready to adopt a new rendering model with server as a first-class citizen
