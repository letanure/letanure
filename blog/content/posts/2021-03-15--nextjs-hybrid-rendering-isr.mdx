Next.js keeps evolving as the go-to framework for building fast React apps. One of its biggest advantages is supporting multiple rendering strategies in the same app:

- Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- Client-Side Rendering (CSR)
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

This flexibility lets you serve content based on your use case—fast static content, dynamic content when needed, and everything in between.

## Hybrid Rendering in Practice

You can mix SSR and SSG in the same project. For example:

- A homepage rendered statically at build time
- A product page rendered with SSR for real-time pricing
- A blog post page updated every 10 minutes with ISR

This gives you speed **and** freshness.

## Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

ISR allows you to update static pages **after** deployment without rebuilding the whole site. You set a `revalidate` time per page, and Next.js handles the regeneration in the background.

```js
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const data = await fetchData();

  return {
    props: { data },
    revalidate: 600, // Regenerate the page every 10 minutes
  };
}
```

The first request after the revalidate time triggers the update. Users never see a loading state.

## Example Use Case

Let’s say you're building an e-commerce site:

- `/products` can use SSG for performance.
- `/products/[id]` can use SSR or ISR to show real-time stock or price.
- `/checkout` uses CSR for dynamic interaction.

This setup improves speed, SEO, and developer experience without sacrificing flexibility.

## Final Thoughts

Next.js makes high-performance React apps easier to build. With features like ISR, you can have the best of both worlds—fast, static-like performance with dynamic data updates when needed.
