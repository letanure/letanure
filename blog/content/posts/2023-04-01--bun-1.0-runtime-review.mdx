Bun 1.0 is out. It's a new JavaScript runtime built in Zig, and it aims to be fast—very fast.

It’s not just a runtime. It also includes:

- A bundler
- A test runner
- A package manager
- A development server

All built in.

Bun tries to replace several tools at once: Node, Webpack, Jest, even npm.

## Installing Bun

To install Bun:

```bash
curl https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

You get access to the `bun` command, which works like `node`, `npm`, and `vite`—all at once.

## Creating a Bun project

You can start a new project like this:

```bash
bun init
```

Then run your server:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

Bun supports TypeScript out of the box—no config, no transpile step.

## Why it’s interesting

- Bun uses JavaScriptCore (from Safari), not V8
- Written in Zig, so it compiles to a single binary
- It's fast—cold starts and installs are much quicker than Node

## What I tried

I migrated a simple server from Node to Bun:

```ts
// index.ts
export default {
  port: 3000,
  fetch(request: Request) {
    return new Response("Hello from Bun!");
  },
};
```

Then ran:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

Worked instantly.

Install times for dependencies were about 10x faster than npm.

## Gotchas

- Not all Node APIs are supported
- Still new—some ecosystem gaps
- No Windows support at the time of writing

## Should you use it?

Bun is promising. It’s great for:

- Simple scripts
- Side projects
- Trying something fast and new

For large teams, the Node ecosystem is still more mature. But Bun is improving fast.

Bun 1.0 might not replace your entire toolchain today, but it's worth keeping an eye on.
