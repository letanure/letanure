Astro is a modern static site builder that introduced a refreshing idea: **do less in the browser**. While other frameworks focus on how to make client-side rendering faster, Astro focuses on _not sending JavaScript unless necessary_.

This idea is called **island architecture**.

## What is island architecture?

It means you can mix multiple frameworks (React, Svelte, Vue, etc.) in your page, but only hydrate specific parts – the "islands" of interactivity. The rest of the page stays static, like pure HTML and CSS.

Benefits:

- Less JavaScript in the browser
- Faster load times and better Lighthouse scores
- Easy integration of different components
- Good for content-focused sites like blogs, docs, marketing

## Getting started with Astro

Install Astro:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

Select the minimal template or one with a framework like React or Svelte.

Run dev server:

```bash
cd your-project
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Using components

You can import components from different frameworks inside `.astro` files:

```javascript
---
import MyReactComponent from '../components/MyReactComponent.jsx';
import Counter from '../components/Counter.svelte';
---

<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Static content is fast</h1>
    <MyReactComponent client:load />
    <Counter client:idle />
  </body>
</html>
```

Each interactive block is hydrated only when needed:

- `client:load` runs after page loads
- `client:idle` waits for browser idle time
- `client:visible` waits until the component is in view

## Output

Astro renders static HTML for everything else. You don’t send React or Svelte runtime if you don’t need it. That’s a big performance win.

## When to use Astro?

Astro is great for:

- Blogs
- Documentation
- Marketing sites
- Sites with mostly static content and a few dynamic parts

If your app is very dynamic or needs lots of client-side interactivity, use something like Next.js or SvelteKit.

## Final thoughts

Astro follows a smart idea: send less to the browser. Use components when needed. Keep the rest static. In a time where performance matters, this shift makes a lot of sense.

Astro gives you control over interactivity, framework flexibility, and great performance by default.
