# Claude Code: Part 4 - Slash Commands and Custom Commands

## The Problem

You type the same instructions to Claude every day: "Run tests", "Check TypeScript errors", "Review changes". Repetitive and wasteful.

## The Solution

Slash commands turn repeated instructions into shortcuts. `/test` replaces paragraphs of testing instructions.

## Built-in Commands

```bash
/clear      # Fresh start
/compact    # Compress history  
/help       # Show commands
/agents     # Manage subagents
/add-dir    # Add working directory
/bug        # Report bug
/config     # Show configuration
/mcp        # MCP servers
/review     # Request code review
/exit       # End session
```

## Custom Commands

Create `.claude/commands/test-all.md`:

```markdown
1. Run pnpm type:check
2. Run pnpm lint
3. Run pnpm test
4. Report issues
```

Now `/test-all` runs everything.

### Example Commands

`.claude/commands/morning.md`: Daily setup (git pull, tests, status)
`.claude/commands/ready.md`: Pre-commit checks
`.claude/commands/review.md`: PR preparation


## Organization

Group commands by phase (planning/, development/, deployment/) or domain (frontend/, backend/, testing/).

## Best Practices

- Be specific: "Check TypeScript errors in src/" not "Check code"
- Include success criteria: "0 test failures, 80% coverage"
- Keep commands under 10 steps
- Use numbered lists for clarity

## Sharing Commands

- **Team:** Commit `.claude/commands/` to git
- **Personal:** Use `~/.claude/commands/` globally

## Advanced Features

Commands can include:
- Parameters: "Ask for feature name, create feature/[name]"
- Conditionals: "If production, run security scan"
- Context awareness: "Analyze current file"


## Getting Started

1. Identify what you repeat daily
2. Create `.claude/commands/[name].md`
3. Keep instructions under 10 steps
4. Test and refine

Slash commands eliminate repetitive instructions.
